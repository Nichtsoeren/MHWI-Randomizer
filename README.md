# MHWI-Randomizer
Monster Hunter World and Iceborne Randomizer

This 'Randomizer' only suggests certain Monsters, Challenges and Weapons. It doesn't automatically equip the right Equipment or anything like that.
This is mainly aimed towards Endgame Players, who are looking to switch Things up a bit or add an extra challenge for themself.

The displayed Playernames can be easily edited, however these edits do not remain betweeen restarts of the Programm.

This Randomizer includes every Monster and Weapon, however you can remove any Monster, Challenge or Weapon from the Randomizer by deleting them from the respective TXT-/CSV-File in the data-Folder. 
Do Note though, that removing Bow or the Bowguns may cause unintendet Results.

As this is the one of my first 'major' Projects I coded and my first Interaction with JSwing, there are bound to be some Bugs and Problems. If you find any, do let me know and I will try to fix them. Otherwise would Feedback of what to improve or add also be appreciated. 

And last but not least, have Fun hunting!
